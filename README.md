👦𝗔𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗺𝗲: 
                     I'm driven by data
                     and motivated by quality

The quote by Tukey that you've read above greatly reflects my approach to data science. If we spend 80% of our time processing data, then our focus should be on understanding the data and asking the right questions. My 2 years of experience have taught me how to appreciate data and take a data-centric approach. I want to create solutions to common problems and make artificial intelligence accessible to everyone.

✔     Data Science
✔     Machine Learning
✔     Deep Learning
✔     Data Analysis using Python and Spark
✔     Statistical Analysis using R
✔     Database programming using MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle
✔     Data Visualization using Tableau, Power BI, Excel
✔     Cloud Computing using AWS, GCP, Azure
