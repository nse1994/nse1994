Hello there!👋 I am a graduate student at the University of South Florida majoring in Electrical Engineering, with a specialization in Machine Learning and Statistical Data Analysis.

### 👦About me: 
                     Driven by data
                     Motivated by quality

What motivates me is the opportunity to derive meaningful insights from data, build quality solutions, and modernize & optimize business processes. My 2years of experience has taught me how to appreciate data and how it can be used to help businesses thrive. I have gone above and beyond the client, expectations to deliver results and help myself grow as an individual.


### 💼 My experiences and core competencies: 
As an upcoming 3rd-semester graduate student, I have worked as a :

①    Data Scientist/ Machine Learning Engineer at Welbilt, where l learned about computer vision, and how to use TensorFlow API and parallel computing—where I deployed a trained ML model into a GPU device.
②    Software Engineer at Jabil, where I learned more about python and object-oriented programming. I worked with the development team to create and test software for a medical device. 


### My core competencies include: 
✔     Data Science
✔     Machine Learning
✔     Deep Learning
✔     Data Analysis using Python and Spark
✔     Statistical Analysis using R
✔     Database programming using MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle
✔     Data Visualization using Tableau, Power BI, Excel
✔     Cloud Computing using AWS

### 💡Fun Facts: 
▪️ I am preparing for AWS Solutions Architect certification 
▪️ In my free time, I would watch Scifi shows on  Netflix or play 🎮PS4 or play 🎾Tennis
▪️ Did you know GPT-3 can build websites?!!

I will be graduating from USF in May 2021, and I am interested in full-time and internship opportunities in Data Science, Machine Learning, and Software Engineering. Please feel free to look through my profile and reach out at any time at 📧nse1@usf.edu or https://www.linkedin.com/in/nse1994/. I look forward to meeting you!
